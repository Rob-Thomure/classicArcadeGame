## Instructions

The objective of the game is to direct the player to the water, without colliding into
any of the bugs. Movement of the player is controlled by using the arrow keys(up, down, left, right) on keyboard. If the player collides with a bug, the game is reset and the player is placed at the starting position. If the player reaches the water, the player wins and the game is reset and the player is placed at the starting position.
